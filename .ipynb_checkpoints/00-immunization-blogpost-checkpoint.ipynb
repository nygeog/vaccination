      "###Instructions\n",
      "This is an individual effort styled after Kaiser Fung\u2019s Junk Charts, with a heavy, tedious technical component.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Think about the graph(s) and write about it critically using the theoretical framework underpinning data visualization (marks, scales, transformations, statistics, etc; the Grammar of Graphics; visual semantics). This part doesn\u2019t involve any code.\n",
      "2. In light of your own criticism, design an improvement. You might want to sketch on paper, a napkin, or a board, and include a picture.\n",
      "3. Attempt to implement your improvement.\n",
      "4. Document your implementation.\n",
      "5. Make your discussion, design, implementation, and documentation publicly available on your fork of the repository. This involves fighting with github, Jekyll, and gh-pages.\n",
      "6. Prepare and submit your blog post from your fork as a pull request to the class repository. This means that it merges cleanly, includes only the files it should, and is rebased onto upstream/gh-pages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Submitted as pull requests of markdown or html on github, examining published graphs and improving them. Entries should include: - source of original with link - discussion of what was wrong with the graph in the first place - theoretical improvements \u2014 if the problem is a color scale, what are you replacing a rainbow with?\n",
      "\n",
      "Either in your post or in a link (such as to Plunker or a Gist / bl.ocks rendering): - methods (preferably code; inline, included, or linked to a branch on your fork of the repo) for retrieving and extracting the data used. - if the data in \u2018raw\u2019 form was not suitable for plotting, code to reshape / \u2018clean\u2019 the data - if applicable, a link to the clean data file you used - code (inline, markdown) to create your replacement graphic(s)\n",

      "#The Critique (1 & 2) \n",
      "\n",
      "The Los Angeles Times published an article **[Fewer California parents refuse to vaccinate children](http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-immunization-data-20150123-story.html)** along with it, a map to **[Look up your California kindergarten's vaccination rate](http://spreadsheets.latimes.com/immunization-levels-california/)**. The main argument is summed up in the shareline - *\"A new California law makes it harder to get personal belief waivers from vaccinations.\"* Below is a screenshot that links to the map and data. \n",

      "##Complaints:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The Leaflet map loads very slow for some reason and zoom and panning are very slow in response. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. Due to the amount of points for schools, showing the whole state of California doesn't give the map viewer a clear picture of MMR immunization at the state level. There should be a geographic administrative unit, such as county to better view it. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. The fields in the table below the map show the following data:\n",
      "    Name, City, Type, Herd Immunity, Enrollment, Personal beliefs exemptions, Personal beliefs rate, Percent change from 2013, MMR immunization rate. Why not **only** include them in a map pop-up window? \n",
      "    \n",
      "    \n",
      "#Improvement (3)\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Again, using [CartoDB](https://cartodb.com/) should help improve the responsiveness of this slippy map. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. (a) This choropleth map, with county as the geographic administrative unit, correctly conveys a solution to Complaint 3. \n",

      "\n",
      "   (b) I'll download the article's data, group by County (a field in the data) to create an Average Immunization Rate (change maybe to total rate, as combining averages is not a good idea). Then I'll download a California County shapefile to join the immunization rates by county to the county shapefile. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. I'll create an info window so map users can click on the school and get the same information. \n",
